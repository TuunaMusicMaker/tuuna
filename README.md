# TUUNA Music Maker
Tuuna Music Maker is a Full Stack web-application that allows registered users to create songs with a digital piano displayed on the page. Registered users can share their songs with other people via text message, make comments on a song, edit their user profile, listen to songs of other users, and like songs of other users. Non-registered users can view and listen to all of the songs and use the search function to look for a particular song. Tuuna features administrative tools to monitor site activity: allowing administrators to ban users, delete flagged content, and unflag any erroneously flagged content. Using Spring, Thymeleaf, Tone.js, Materialize, and Font Awesome; Tuuna Music Maker truly is anything but a fish out of water!

### Our Team

Tuuna Music Maker was created, in partnership, by Stuart Hamblin, Steven Quintanilla, Joaquin Silva, and David Stephens.

##### Stuart Hamlin
Primarily responsible for the creation of methods for saving songs to the MySQL database in the song recording process and allowing them to be used for replay, Stuart is also the mind behind Tuuna Music Maker.

##### Steven Quintanilla
Creating a mobile-responsive keyboard, allowing for it to be playable by mouse, keyboard, and touch, as well as recording user's compositions in the front end; Steven's contributions truly drove Tuuna to be as user friendly as possible.

##### Joaquin Silva
Working under the hood of Tuuna: Joaquin's contributions include allowing for Java objects to be saved to the MySQL database, as well as leaving likes and comments on songs. Joaquin also made sure to keep the team on task.

##### David Stephens
While tasked with the styling of our application, David has also contributed registration, administrative and search functionality to Tuuna. He also wrote this ReadMe. :)

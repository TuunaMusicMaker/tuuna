# TUUNA Music Maker
Tuuna Music Maker is a web-application that allows registered users to create songs with a digital piano displayed on the page. Registered users can share their songs with other people via text message, make comments on a song, edit their user profile, listen to songs of other users, and like songs of other users. Non-registered users view and listen to all of the songs and use the search function to look for a particular song.
